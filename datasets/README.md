# Breast Cancer Prediction

## Data check
- I have included a program to specify at the command-line which dataset you would like to check for any columns containing NaN values.

### Usage:
- To use the command-line program, you need to execute the `datacheck.py` python file with the `-f` switch in place, followed by the dataset name or location. See below:

- Once executed, should you see the following output. See below:
